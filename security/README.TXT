The folder containes the required ids.whitelist values needed if you use IDS filter


**Currently only mail module settings are in the ids.whitelist file when i get time to testing admin module i will add them as well**

NOTE**
this file IS NOT copied or merged with the existing one in ISPConfig
the reason for this is that i would consider any custom changes to
security critical files that is not done by myself is highly insecure

so you will have to add them yourself if needed

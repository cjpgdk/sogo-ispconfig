Installation
--------------
since the update of [ISPConfig] to version 3.0.4.5p3 the old versions of this addon is not recommended to use, but as this is your choice have a look here [Update 9]

##### Note
Since i moved it all into GitHub the old links in the installer do not work any more and the only way can install [Update 9] is by getting started here [Update 9]

Once i get finished with Update 10, you will be able to use it with only the files you download no out going links, and it will feature installing SOGo, updating from earlier version etc.. just like the old installer

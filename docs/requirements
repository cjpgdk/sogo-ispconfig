PHP >= 5.3.0

ISPConfig >= 3.0.4.6 (maybe it works on older versions but i do not test them)

---


if you use ISPConfig 3.0.4.x.
    SOGo MUST BE installed on the same server as your mail server the reason
    is that the server plugin and module requires the mail actions,
    and remote action is not available before version 3.0.5

from ISPConfig version 3.0.5 and up remote action can be used and SOGo can be 
placed on a separate server. (WITH ISPConfig installed)

oldest test version of SOGo is 2.0.2a
    keep in mind this plugin builds configuration, aimed 
    at the latest release of SOGo.

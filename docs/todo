@todo add check if auto create domain is allowed?
@todo create setting to set auto create allowed or not
@todo in multi server setups maybe use domain to SOGo server map

TODO list with low very low priority

install sql permissions when installing on none master.

TODO list with a maybe i will add/fix it
*****

On SOGo config insert..?
-
run rebuild SOGO config.. not sure if you install this and create the configs you are properply 
going over all options and checking your domains, and in the end you trigger and update that will call the rebuild
